Before the execution of line 2 (print("Love")), a total of 44 small
integer objects are created and still in memory.

The reason for this is due to an optimization in CPython.
CPython caches and reuses a range of small integer objects to improve memory
and execution efficiency.
These integers are often used for common integer values in Python code.
The range is defined by NSMALLPOSINTS and NSMALLNEGINTS.
